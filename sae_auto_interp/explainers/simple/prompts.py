"Each neuron looks for some particular thing in a short document."\
"You will be given the parts of the documents that activate the neuron."\
"Look at the parts of the document the neuron activates for and summarize in a single sentence what the neuron is looking for."\
"Be specific if you think it activates for a specific token. Don't list examples of words."\
"After each sentence you will get a list of tokens that activate the neuron and its activations. Activation values range from 0 to 10."\
"The higher the activation value, the stronger the match."\
